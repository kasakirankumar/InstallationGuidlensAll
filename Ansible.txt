Ansible installation on AWS

Step 1 : Create a common id on all the machines
# useradd ansible
# passwd ansible

Step 2: Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on the control machine and uncomment out the lines forPasswordAuthentication and PermitRootLogin
Perform the above steps on all the machines. Once completed, restart the sshd service on both the machines
# systemctl restart sshd

For complete automation of tasks, we will need passwordless SSH authentication

Step 3 : To enable passwordless authentication to perform the steps shown below. Firstly add the user ansible to the /etc/sudoers file on all  the machines which will enable the user ansible to run any command which requires root privileges

Step 4: Create private and public key in all the machines to communicate one and each 
              other with ssh 
[ansible@ip-172-31-21-70 ~]$ ssh-keygen

Step 5: Copy the public key to the target machine and vice versa.
ssh-copy-id <IP-Address-Host-Machine>

We are now able to log in without entering the password. After the check out of the ssh connectivity on both the machines and be logged in as ansible user

Step 6: install ansible on the Control machine only by enabling the EPEL repo from fedora which provides add-on software packages. Perform the following steps to install ANSIBLE

$ wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm 
$ sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
$ sudo yum install ansible -y 
$ ansible --version 

Step 7: Edit the ansible.cfg file and enable the inventory file parameter on the Control machine
sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible uses the concept of Inventory to manage and track the target machines. By default, this file is located in /etc/ansible/hosts and can be changed as well. A host file consists of groups for better classification and multiple machines under the group. All the required machines can be added to those groups.

Every group is denoted by a square bracket and a group name within. A server can actually exist in multiple groups.
